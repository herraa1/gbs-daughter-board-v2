## Introduction

The GBS Daughter Board v2 is a companion board for the GBS8200 upscaler.
It facilitates the upgrade of an off-the-shelf GBS8200 board to a gbs-control firmware based solution, with the following main features:

* HAT-like design, simply stack the daughter board on top of the existing GBS8200
* add SCART RGB input
* add switchable HDMI output (via embedded VGA to HDMI dongle)
* add switchable sync stripper based on the LM1881
* add 3.5" jack sound output
* add switchable common or separate audio ground
* add auxiliar USB socket to optionally power external dongle
* add small OLED screen and rotary encoder for local control
